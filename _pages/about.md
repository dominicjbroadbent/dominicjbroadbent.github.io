I am a final-year PhD student in Computational Statistics at the [COMPASS CDT](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/cdt/compass/) in the School of Mathematics, University of Bristol, supervised by Professors [Nick Whiteley](https://sites.google.com/view/nickwhiteley/) and [Robert Allison](https://research-information.bris.ac.uk/en/persons/robert-f-allison).  

My research focuses on *distribution compression*, developing methods that replace large datasets with smaller, representative sets while preserving their key statistical properties. In particular, I study kernel-based approaches in *Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces* (RKHS), where we have extended compression beyond unlabelled (marginal) distributions to joint and conditional distributions, and further to dimensionality reduction. More broadly, I am interested in approaches that enable large-scale machine learning while reducing the *financial, environmental, and computational* costs of modern artificial intelligence.

When I am not doing research, I enjoy reading books (usually involving some sort of wizard or dragon) and playing games (thorougly addicted to Total War). I also enjoy outdoor sports such as bouldering and running.
