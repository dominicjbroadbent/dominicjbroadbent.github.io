I am a final-year PhD student (graduating March 2026) in Computational Statistics at the [COMPASS CDT](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/cdt/compass/) in the School of Mathematics, University of Bristol, supervised by Professors [Nick Whiteley](https://sites.google.com/view/nickwhiteley/) and [Robert Allison](https://research-information.bris.ac.uk/en/persons/robert-f-allison). I am open to roles in Data Science, Machine Learning Research, or Statistics, based in Bristol, where I can apply my strong background in mathematics and software development. I have extensive experience developing in Python in a Linux environment, where I have focused on producing robust, reproducible code, with extensive experience using Git for version control. I also have exposure to cloud development via AWS and high-performance computing (HPC), enabling me to handle demanding computational workloads and deploy scalable solutions effectively.

My research has focused on *distribution compression*, developing methods that replace large datasets with smaller, representative sets while preserving their key statistical properties. In particular, I study kernel-based approaches in *Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces* (RKHS), where we have extended compression beyond unlabelled (marginal) distributions to joint and conditional distributions, and further to dimensionality reduction. More broadly, I am interested in approaches that enable large-scale machine learning while reducing the *financial, environmental, and computational* costs of modern artificial intelligence.

When I am not doing research, I enjoy reading (currently working my way through the Dark Tower series) and playing games (thoroughly addicted to Total War). I also enjoy outdoor sports such as bouldering and running.
