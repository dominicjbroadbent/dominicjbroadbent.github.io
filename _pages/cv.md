## Industry Experience

**Machine Learning Researcher, Civil Service (Mar 2024 - Oct 2025)**
- Suspended my PhD studies for a placement in the civil service via the Alan Turing Institute.
- Researched and implemented machine learning methods for data compression using JAX.
- Collaborated within an Agile development team, running GPU workloads on AWS instances accessed via SSH.

**Data Quality Analyst, [Beauhurst](https://www.beauhurst.com/) (Temp, Jun 2019 - present)**
- Work around 20 hours per week alongside full-time undergraduate and PhD studies.
- Responsible for maintaining the quality of the company’s database of fast-growing UK businesses. Tasks include categorising companies based on online and financial activity, gathering and publishing relevant news, and ensuring key employee information remains up to date. 
- Review and approve edits made by other team members before pushing verified updates live to subscribers.
- Conduct ad-hoc machine learning projects as required — for example, developing an NLP model in Python (using NLTK) to detect when a company has rebranded or pivoted. This involved computing similarity scores between old and new company blurbs and tuning a threshold hyperparameter to automatically flag cases requiring further review.
