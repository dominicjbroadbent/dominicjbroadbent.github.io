## Conditional Distribution Compression via the Kernel Conditional Mean Embedding
Dominic Broadbent, Nick Whiteley, Robert Allison, Tom Lovett  
*NeurIPS 2025.*  
In this work, we extend the concept of distribution compression, which summarises a large dataset using a much smaller, representative subset, to the labelled setting. Specifically, we generalise existing methods from acting on marginal distributions to operating on joint and conditional distributions, enabling a broad range of downstream tasks such as classification and regression.

## Bilateral Distribution Compression: Reducing Both Data Size and Dimensionality
Dominic Broadbent, Nick Whiteley, Robert Allison, Tom Lovett  
*Submitted to ICLR 2025.*  
In this work, we further extend the concept of distribution compression, where one usually reduces just the number of observations of a target dataset, to also include reducing the number of dimensions. These *bilaterally* compressed sets can achieve over 99.99% compression with minimal loss in performance across various downstream tasks such as regression, classification and clustering.
